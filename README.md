This is supposed to eventually be a Rust library for manipulating p-adic numbers. Currently, only a couple operations are supported (addition and subtraction). Everything is lazy-evaluated (we _are_ multiplying **infinite** amounts of digits), so it will just compute the amount you need to display. The type system is kinda weird (having to do references and parentheses) but hopefully this will be resolved.
