This is supposed to eventually be a Rust library for manipulating p-adic numbers. Currently, only a few operations are supported (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Everything is lazy-evaluated (we _are_ multiplying **infinite** amounts of digits), so it will just compute the amount you need to display. There is a language that goes along with it when you start the program currently.
